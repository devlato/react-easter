## Installation

```sh
$ npm install react-easter
```


## Usage

The usage is very simple, there is just a couple of props to pass.

```jsx
const EasterEgg = require('react-easter');

// ...

render() {
  return (
    <EasterEgg keys={/* Array of keys to type to trigger the easter egg */}
               simultaneous={/* Add this prop if keys should be pressed all together */}
               timeout={/* Duration to show your easter egg, is not passed the easter egg is displayed forever */}>
      {/* Your easter egg JSX goes here */}
    </EasterEgg>
  );
}
```

For example:

```jsx
const EasterEgg = require('react-easter');


export default class YourComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const konamiCode = [
      'arrowup',
      'arrowup',
      'arrowdown',
      'arrowdown',
      'arrowleft',
      'arrowright',
      'arrowleft',
      'arrowright',
      'b',
      'a',
      'enter'
    ];

    return (
      <EasterEgg keys={konamiCode}
                 timeout={5000}>
        <div class="overlay">
          <iframe class="sexy-nude-geek-girls-playing-mario"
                  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLzxrzFCyOs"
                  frameborder="0"
